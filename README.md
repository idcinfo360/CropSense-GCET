## Executive Summary
**Goal:** Develop a real-time, offline AI solution to diagnose crop diseases and nutrient deficiencies in tomato, rice, and wheat—directly on mobile phones or drones.

**Problem:** Crop diseases and nutrient deficiencies lead to 20–40% yield losses in India, affecting over 150 million smallholder farmers.

**Key Features:**
- Deep learning model (ResNet-50 + CBAM attention)
- Achieves 93.4% accuracy on diverse field images
- Edge-optimized: ~60 ms inference, model size just 6 MB
- Runs fully offline, enabling use in low-connectivity rural zones
- Multilingual mobile app (English & Hindi) with drone-based monitoring

**Notable Achievements:**
- Delivers accurate diagnosis across variable field conditions
- Empowers farmers with rapid, actionable insights
- Ready for integration with Digital Agriculture Mission and agritech platforms

**Impact:**
- Minimizes crop losses
- Boosts decision-making and farm productivity
- Bridges technology access for rural communities

**Future Vision:**
- Scale to additional crops
- Integrate multispectral sensors for even earlier detection
- Enable federated learning for continuous model improvement

## Introduction / Background
Agriculture supports 58% of India’s population, with tomato, rice, and wheat as key crops. Smallholder farmers face significant productivity challenges due to diseases and nutrient deficiencies. Smartphones and drones present an opportunity for AI-driven diagnostics, but current solutions often require internet or lack nutrient deficiency detection.

## Problem Statement
Need for a real-time, offline AI system to detect and differentiate crop diseases and nutrient deficiencies in tomato, rice, and wheat for rural, low-connectivity environments.

**Key Challenges:**
- Visual similarity of symptoms
- Diverse field conditions
- Resource constraints for edge devices
- Real-time operation (<1s)
- User accessibility (multilingual, intuitive UI)

## Objectives and Scope
**Objectives:**
- Robust AI Model: Classify six diseases and three nutrient deficiencies with >90% accuracy
- Edge Deployment: Offline use (<10 MB, <1s inference) on smartphones/drones
- User-Friendly Interface: Mobile app and drone prototype with English/Hindi support
- Field Validation: High accuracy in semi-arid conditions
- Integration Potential: Align with government and private platforms

**Scope:**
- Leaf-based RGB image diagnosis for tomato, rice, and wheat
- Six diseases and three deficiencies
- Offline edge processing
- Prototype phase, scalable for future applications
